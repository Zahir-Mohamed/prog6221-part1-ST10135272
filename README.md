This is a C# console application for managing recipes. It allows the user to enter recipe details such as ingredients and steps, display the recipe, scale the recipe by a factor, reset ingredient quantities to their original values, clear the recipe, and exit the program.

The Recipe class contains a list of tuples to store ingredient details and a list of strings to store recipe steps. It also has methods to scale the recipe by a factor and display the recipe.

The Main method creates a Recipe object and uses a while loop to display a menu of options and prompt the user for input. Depending on the user's choice, the program performs various actions on the Recipe object, such as adding ingredients and steps, scaling the recipe, resetting quantities, clearing the recipe, and exiting the program.
